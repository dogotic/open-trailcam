# open-trailcam
This is the repository for an attempt to create an open source trail camera. 
Since most of the commercial trail cameras use some kind of proprietary or hard to get (as an individual) SoCs, possibly custom cameras, in this project 
We will try to use of the shelf easly accessible components that everyone can buy, solder, flash etc. to create a trail camera. 

For the first attempt we will use :  

- STM32 Blue Pill with STM32F103C8T6 chip
- SIM7100 modem

And try to send an SMS to an another phone to verify communication and operation between STM32 and SIM7100 4G modem.
